The Empty Jar

At the start of the year, write down a note a week. This will be collected in your jar. At the end of the year, look at how great your year was. 

This is a simple iPhone app that you can use to collect weekly notes or just notes in general. Using this to learn table views and some basic core data. If I can clean it up, I may submit this to the app store.
